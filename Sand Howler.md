_**Keen Hearing and Smell.**_ The sand howler has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

_**Pack Tactics.**_ The sand howler has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the sand howler's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't *incapacitated*.

_**Paralyzing Gaze.**_ When a creature that can see a sand howler’s eyes starts its turn within 15 feet of any sand howler, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the sand howlers aren’t incapacitated and the creature can see any of them. On a failed saving throw, the creature is *paralyzed* for 1d4 rounds. The *paralyzed* creature can attempt to make another saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Once a creature succeeds on a saving throw against this ability, any paralysis ends and the creature is immune to the ability for 24 hours.
